# IOS-Extreme-Menu


This repository contains an advanced, visually and technically complex mod menu for Dead by Daylight on iOS, built entirely with native Objective-C code. The project is unfinished and the code is not fully optimized, but it is shared for educational purposes only.

The goal is to help developers understand the underlying functions, game engine interactions, and native iOS-level implementations used in mod menu development. Currently, this is one of the most visually advanced mod menus on iOS using purely native code.

This project is for educational use only.
